                <p>Robotics is a branch that combines science and engineering, 
                    including mechanical engineering, electronics engineering,
                    computer science, software engineering. Many technologies
                    such as design, construction, operation, computer systems, 
                    control, sensory feedback, and information processing are
                    used to create machines to mimic human actions.  </p>
                <p>
                    Robots are mostly used to replace humans in dangerous 
                    environments, such as bomb detection and deactivation, 
                    manufacturing processes and in general in situations where
                    a human cannot survive. Many robot manufacturers create robots
                    that operate autonomously and replicate human behaviors.
                    These robots replicate speech, cognition, walking, sensing,
                    and belong to a robotics field of inspired robotics.

                    "The word robotics was derived from the word robot, which was
                    introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Capek in his 
                    play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published 
                    in 1920. The word robot comes from the Slavic word rabota,
                    which means labour/work. The play begins in a factory that 
                    makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be
                    mistaken for humans  very similar to the modern ideas of 
                    androids. Karel Capek himself did not coin the word. He wrote
                    a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford 
                    English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Capek 
                    as its actual originator."

                <p>
                    Humanoid robots is a field of robotics that creates robots 
                    to resemble the human body and human behavior. Humanoid 
                    Robots have torso, arms, legs, head and Android robots 
                    are build to look like humans so they have facial features
                    such as eyes and mouths. The complexity of performing human
                    tasks is immense but they are already perform tasks as 
                    reception desks administrators and automotive line production
                    workers. They can also entertain humans by playing music,
                    singing or dancing.  Most importantly, humanoid robots, as 
                    mentioned above, are used for useful and dangerous missions
                    such as distant space explorations without having the need
                    to return to earth after their mission
