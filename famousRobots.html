            <p>Honda started the development of Assimo in year 1986. They wanted 
                to create a walking robot by simulating human's walk. These 
                are the early models:E1,E2,E3. For the next generation of Assimo
                E4, E5, E6, Honda focused on stabilization and stair climbing.  
                Then in order to improve the functionality of Assimo, arms, body, and head were added.  
               Assimo is considered as the most advanced humanoid robot but also the most
               expensive as it is cost about 2.5 million dollars.

            <p>One year ago Sophia, the famous robot of Hanson Robotics, 
                became a full citizen of Saudi Arabia. Sophia said that "I
                am very honored and proud of this unique distinction. This 
                is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized
                with a citizenship." It is not quite clear what exactly rights
                Sophia holds with this citizenship status. One should refer 
                to EU committee and the personhood option about the rights of 
                the robots.  </p>
